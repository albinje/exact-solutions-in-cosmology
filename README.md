# Exact Solutions in FLRW Cosmology
This github tries to keep track of the list published articles on exact solutions in various Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker cosmological scenarios. Each entry contains the paper title, a small summary of the method used in the work and also the arxiv link. I am a graduate student working on cosmology and I created this github page just for fun and to help anyone with similar interests.  If I have missed any cosmology papers that you believe should be included please email me at albinje@iiserb.ac.in or issue a pull request.
